Tdarr Node {{ .Release.Name }} has been deployed.

This is a Tdarr transcoding node that connects to the Tdarr server.
Nodes do not expose any services - they connect to the server and register automatically.

To check the node status:
  kubectl logs --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "tdarr_node.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}"

The node will appear in the Tdarr server UI once it successfully connects.
